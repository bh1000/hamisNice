    Instructions

1. Download the above tarball.
2. Extract it somewhere.
3. Move the enclosed `hamisNice` folder to your Noita mods folder, located under your steam directory in `%steamdir%/steamapps/common/Noita/mods`.
4. Make sure it's enabled in the Mods section of the Noita menu, under the name *"Hamis"*.
5. Start a new game. You will automatically pick up the H√§mis perk, which allows for emoting within a set pixel radius (currently 25px), which will be adjustable in a later release. Hold a wand (or nothing, but just don't throw your items), and hold your right mouse button to hold a thumbs up.
